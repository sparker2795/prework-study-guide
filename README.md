# < Sam's Prework Study Guide>

I built this study guide for bootcamp students to help their learning and studying of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

Throughout this building process, I learned introductory information on begginer level coding skills including the following; coding languages such as HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript; how to use GitHub, Git flow, and common git commands; Common coding jargon.
